## data information

"Moonmilk samples were collected from four caves, three in Romania: Ferice and Fața Apei caves located in Apuseni Mountains (north-western Romania), Izvorul Tăușoarelor Cave (Rodnei Mountains, northern Romania), and one in south-eastern Brazil: Nestor Cave from north Minas Gerais State."

The accession numbers are found in the data directory in the script called sequences.sh

This study used the V3-V4 region of the 16S gene with 314F and 805R primers (they cited a paper with a method that I dont have access to so I am imaging this is the sequence):
16S Amplicon PCR Forward Primer 314F = 5'

16S Amplicon PCR Reverse Primer 805R= 5'
